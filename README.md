# dartbeginner

I am currently exploring the Dart programming language.

## Getting Started

To execute the program and check the results, follow these steps:

Open VSCode and set the working directory to the "dartbeginner" folder.
Open the Terminal using the shortcut Ctrl + ` or by selecting "View" in the menu bar and choosing "Terminal."
In the Terminal, use the following commands to navigate to the "lib" folder and then to "lesson5":
bash
Copy code
``cd lib``
``cd lesson5``
Finally, run the "lesson5.dart" file with the command:
bash
Copy code
dart run lesson5.dart
This sequence of steps will ensure that you can efficiently run your Dart programs and verify their outcomes.
