# dartbeginner

I am currently exploring the Dart programming language.

## Getting Started

My assignment is located in the "lib" folder.

To execute the program and check the results, follow these steps: </br>

Open VSCode and set the working directory to the "dartbeginner" folder.</br>
Open the Terminal using the shortcut **Ctrl + `** or by selecting "View" in the menu bar and choosing "Terminal."</br>
In the Terminal, use the following commands to navigate to the "lib" folder and then to "lesson5":</br>
`cd lib`</br>
`cd lesson5`</br>
Finally, run the "lesson5.dart" file with the command:</br>
`dart run lesson5.dart`</br>
This sequence of steps will ensure that you can efficiently run your Dart programs and verify their outcomes.
